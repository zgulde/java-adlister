# MVC

- A *design pattern*: a pattern prescription for solving common problems
    - a way to *architect* our code
- Seperates our code into three distinct pieces
    - data
    - presentation
    - logic
- Most popular way to organize/build the backend for web applications
- How to communicate between servlets + jsps? `.getRequestDispatcher` `.forward`
    - we should do this from now on
    - side effect: prettier urls
- hello.jsp
- move logic to a servlet
- JavaBean: a class that represents a thing
    - data container
    - private properties, getters and setters
    - usually maps to a row in a database table
    - many Java libraries work with beans
- Create a Greeting class
- DAO: design pattern for obtaining/manipulating data
    - object that abstracts the specifics of data access
    - usually behind an interface (for easy swappability + good architecture)
- Factory: a class that creates objects
    - creates/gives access to objects in a certain way
        - enforce some constraints, pass certain arguments to the constructors
    - alternative to "directly" creating objects (w/ the objects constructor)
